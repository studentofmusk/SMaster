# SMaster - Sign Language Learning App

SMaster is an interactive learning application designed to teach sign language with real-time action detection. It consists of multiple components working together to provide a seamless experience for users.

## Project Structure
This project is divided into four main components, each hosted in a separate repository:

1. **[Admin Client](https://github.com/studentofmusk/SMaster-ADMIN)** - A web-based platform for managing courses.
2. **[ML Flask Server](https://github.com/studentofmusk/SMaster-ML-SERVER)** - A machine learning server for real-time action detection.
3. **[Node.js Server](https://github.com/studentofmusk/SMaster-SERVER)** - The backend server managing user interactions and course data.
4. **[React Native Application](https://github.com/studentofmusk/SMaster-APP)** - The mobile application for users to learn sign language interactively.

## Installation and Setup

### Clone the Main Repository
This repository serves as an overview and does not contain the actual code. Clone the sub-repositories separately:
